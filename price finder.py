#This program takes in a URL as its input, takes the HTML from the webpage, 
#searches for a list of products and compiles the name and prices of the products
#It does this in two ways:
#Number 1 - It will search for a table header tag <th> and look for the strings
#"product" and "price", and store the data
#Number 2 - If such a table does not exist, then the program will look for
#tags/attributes
